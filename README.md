# twiddler
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Goals
- Implement a simple interface that renders fake tweets generated by a script. 
- Display time stamps relative to when the 'load more tweets' button is pressed as well as username handles
- Implement a feature where clicking on the user's handle will filter tweets only authored by that specific user.
